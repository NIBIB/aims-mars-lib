## AIMS MARS Library

The AIMS MARS library is designed to facilitate integration with the AIMS RADx MARS Hub.  This library depends on the base RADx MARS Library "radx-mars-lib."

Future repository pushes will contain sample code specific to this library.  Currently, the sample code for all RADx MARS Library supported Hubs is contained in a unified project `radx-mars-demo`.
